Hi, I'm Entle and this is a short intro about myself. I am currenntly enrolled at Umuzi. I don't have a long history in tech but im really thrilled to be learning and improving my skills. If you're curious, before this I studied financial management. Hobbies include, swimming, reading, gym and most recently coding. Anyway, that is all for now. Happy learning.
